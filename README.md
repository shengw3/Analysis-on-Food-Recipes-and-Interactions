# Analysis-on-Food-Recipes-and-Interactions
Fall 2019 Bayesian Project

We used food recipes & Interactions data from Kaggle.com to find predictive relationship between recipes and customer reviews
and solve classification and regression problems.

We set up 11 graphical models with variational inference and compared them using WAIC to recommend the best model for each question.

This is team project with Mark and Jiaxing. For more information, please refer to the project report.
